The extract_numbers filter plugin in Logstash is used to extract numbers from a specified field and store them in a new field. Here's an example configuration:

========
{ "message": "There are 123 apples and 456 oranges" }

===========
input {
  stdin {}
}

filter {
  extract_numbers {
    field => "message"
    target => "numbers"
  }
}

output {
  stdout { codec => rubydebug }
}
===============
{
  "message": "There are 123 apples and 456 oranges",
  "numbers": [123, 456]
}
